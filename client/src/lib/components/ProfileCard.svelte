				Despite the downturn in the tech market, I feel now is the perfect time for growth,
				exploration, and software development. Us, people in tech, are caught in turbulent times and
				now, more than ever its important that we keep up with our tools and industry as a whole. As
				a software engineer my passion lies in cloud-native development and large scale software
				architecture. I describe myself as a language generalist but most of my experience is with
				Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python. Outside of software development you can likely
				catch me in the gym or playing volleyball with friends on the weekend.

				P.S: If you're into bodybuilding feel free to reach out as I'm looking for serious gym
				friends here in Vancouver.

				Note: A recent favorite discovery is the 'Go Time' podcast, which I highly recommend for
				anyone curious about Go and programming in general.
