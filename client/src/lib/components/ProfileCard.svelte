				Despite the downturn in the tech market, I feel now is the perfect time for growth,
				exploration, and software development. I spend my days learning and developing in Go,
				exploring new research in deep learning, and working on open-source projects. I grew to
				appreciate programming outside of University and found a great way to pass time. My
				expertise lies in 'Data-driven development,' focusing on data engineering and backend
				development.

				Note: A recent favorite discovery is the 'Go Time' podcast, which I highly recommend for
				anyone curious about Go and programming in general.
